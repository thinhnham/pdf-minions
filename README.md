# pdf-minions
combining and splitting pdf files 

## Synopsis

Pdf minions will help users combine two or more pdf files into one single pdf file or split a pdf file into smaller pdf files. 

## Motivation

Pdf minions is simple and user-friendly. The user can combine or split pdf files in less than 30 seconds. The project is made with simple web application tools such as PHP, Javascript, HTML 5 and CSS. 

## Contributors

The current project only has two features : combine and split pdfs. We can convert pdf files to different file formats. However, I am using free PHP libraries and good PHP libraries are expensive. Feel free to expand this project :D !
